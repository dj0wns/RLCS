RAID-Like Cloud Storage (RLCS) aims to provide a solution to the problem of what happens to your data if your cloud storage provider suddenly closes its doors one day. By linking multiple cloud services together and providing parity, we provide a cloud storage solution that is safer and more secure than any other code on the market.
